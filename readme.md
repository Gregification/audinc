***Audinc*** is a simple java swing applicaiton that hosts miscellaneous tools - of which anyone is welcome to add too. There is no restriction on the purpose of the tool, just that it is written in java and on this repo.
- because of how the classes are named the 'tools' will be refereed to as "presents"
- there is no java doc even though some classes have those properties.
# How to contribute
1. make a new class inside the <code>presentables.presents</code> package that extends the <code>presentables.Presentable</code> class. the Presentable class will allow your tool to interface with the gui.
1. copy and paste everyting from the <code>presentables.presentTemplate</code> class into your newly created .java file & change the class name to the correct one.
1. add your class path to the <code>Presents</code> variable in the <code>audinc.gui.MainWin</code> class.
1. start making what ever you want.
